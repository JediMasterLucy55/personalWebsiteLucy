              <p>
                Lucia 'Lucy' Grace Hans is a maybe slightly above average high school student at best, but she has a lot of secrets. The summer before sixth grade, she discovered she was Queen of the Universe and went on a bunch of random wacky adventures that you can here about in the timeline section and if I ever finish animating that clone trooper AU.

                An elf from the Lost Cities and a Jedi Master? Very cool, but very annoying. He dragged Lucy out of life on Earth and into a very strange multiverse. We don't know what's up with him but, that's what he does.

              <p>
                Sparrow is a clone trooper. But not a normal clone trooper. She's MTF trans, and way cooler than you. She's an incredible, and I mean INCREDIBLE, strategist, AND she is excellent at reading a room. I'm jealous! She has a great sense of sarcasm and loves to fool around with Lucy, bc as the only girls in the squad, the have to stick together.

              <p>
                If ADHD existed in Star Wars, Talon would have it. Bro is very hyperactive but INCREDIBLY good with a blaster. A model clone trooper. [clapping emoji] He has an awesome sense of humor but extremely disregards General Ruewen's dad jokes.
